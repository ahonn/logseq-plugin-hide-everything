# Logseq Plugin Hide Everything

A plugin for hiding any UI elements in Logseq that you don't want.

If you are familiar with CSS, you can easily hide certain elements in Logseq's Custom CSS. Therefore, this plugin is designed to help users who are not familiar with CSS or want a convenient way to quickly hide/show elements.
